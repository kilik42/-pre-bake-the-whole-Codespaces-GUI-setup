Purpose

This repository is designed to let students run Pygame programs in GitHub Codespaces with zero environment setup.

Students do not install Python, Pygame, or graphics drivers locally.
All graphical output appears in the browser via a virtual desktop.

This reduces:

setup time

device inequality issues

troubleshooting during class

OS-specific problems (Windows/Mac/Linux)
